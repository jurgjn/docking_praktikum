# docking_praktikum
## Main objective
In this practical we learn about computationally characterising small molecule binding sites in proteins using pocket detection and docking.
## Learning objectives
* Students understand the problem of docking, and the limitations of the approach
* Students understand how changes in protein structure can alter small ligand binding
* Students gain proficiency in docking with a widely used method (autodock vina)
## Resources
This practical will take place in a Colab notebook. One docking run takes approximatelly 5 minutes to execute. Therefore, if necessary, intermediate results can be downloaded from this repository directly to the Colab notebook (see the notebook for detailed instructions).
