# Docking Praktikum
## Main objective
In this practical we learn about computationally characterising small molecule binding sites in proteins using pocket detection and docking.
## Learning objectives
* Students understand the problem of docking, and the limitations of the approach
* Students understand how changes in protein structure can alter small ligand binding
* Students gain proficiency in docking with a widely used method (autodock vina)
## Resources
This practical will take place in a [Colab notebook]
(https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nEknz4lIDoUmCrfPgs9MTbBomGLxcVun?usp=sharing). There's also an additional set of [slides]
(https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1US9_gjpM3zSGGUTkTFqvpWJ8MDuYYnRoCXXNOgK-1G0/edit?usp=sharing) with additional notes on the exercises.
Each docking run takes approximatelly 5 minutes to execute. The repository has all, including intermediate, results to skip steps if necessary.
